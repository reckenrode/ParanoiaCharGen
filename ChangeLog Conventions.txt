A proper changelog should indicate which classes, methods, and functions 
changed. They should be grouped by the files to which they belong, and be 
bulleted with one of three symbols. These symbols are: '+' to represent a new
class/method/function, '-' to indicate the removal of a class/method/function, 
and '*' to indicate that the class/method/function has changed. '-' may also be 
used to indicate that a class/method/function has been moved or renamed. In 
case, list its old name in the entry. Changelogs shouldn't be wider than 80 
columns.

Sample changelog entry:
foo.py
 + bar - description of bar
 - baz - description of baz's removal
 * blat - description of why blat is so much cooler now
